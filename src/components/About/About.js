            Hey there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Aniyah. I am a Full-Stack Developer in
            Columbus, Ohio. I started my career as a Health Insurance
            professional and realized that was environment was not for me so I
            did some research and decided to learn how to code. I have been
            teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript since December of 2021.
            Now after almost completing my bootcamp I have conquered many
            different technologies involved with the backend like SQL, Node.js,
            etc. I hope to find a great opportunity on a team that challenges
            and inspires me to keep learning and advancing in my programming
            abilities and tackle more complex technologies as I go!
